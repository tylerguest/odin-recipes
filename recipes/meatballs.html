            <li>Salt</li>
            <li>Bourbon</li>
            <li>Oil</li>

        </ul>
        <h1>Steps</h1>
        <ol>
            <li>Process the bacon with onion. This ensures a smooth
                finish to the meatballs by grinding up the bacon and
                the onion. If you donâ€™t have a food processor you can
                use a blender, just be sure not to over-blend. Or you
                can finely dice those ingredients if needed.</li>
            <li>Mix ingredients for meat mixture.  Using your hands
                mix up the meats with the remaining ingredients
                needed.</li>
            <li>Form Meatballs. Using a cookie scoop, or tablespoon,
                scoop up the meat and roll with your hands to form
                round ball shapes about 1 inch in diameter. Using
                a scoop helps to ensure a consistent size.</li>
            <li>Cook the meatballs in a skillet until cooked
                throughout. Remove from the skillet, pour out any
                excess grease and then add in the sauces.</li>
            <li>Simmer in the sauce. Let the meatballs cook in the
                sauce for at least 10 minutes (can always do this
                longer for more flavor).</li>
        </ol>
